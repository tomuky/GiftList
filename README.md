# Gift List

This is a demo using a Merkle Tree to prove to the server if a particular name is on the Nice List and eligible for a gift.

To get started with the repository, clone it and then run `npm install` in the top-level directory to install the depedencies.

## Frontend

Run `npm install` again inside the frontend directory to install dependencies.

Then run `npm start` to run the React frontend locally.

## Server

You can run the server from the top-level directory with `node server/index`. This file is an express server which will be hosted on port 1225 and respond to the client's request.

Think of the server as the _verifier_ here. The server will verify if the `name` passed by the frontend is in the `MERKLE_ROOT`. If it is, then we can send the gift! 

## Utils

There are a few files in utils:

- The `niceList.json` which contains all the names of the people who deserve a gift this year (this is randomly generated, feel free to add yourself and others to this list!)
- The `example.js` script shows how we can generate a root, generate a proof and verify that some value is in the root using the proof. Try it out from the top-level folder with `node/example.js`
- The `MerkleTree.js` should look familiar from the Merkle Tree module! This one has been modified so you should not have to deal with any crypto type conversion. You can import this in your client/server
- The `verifyProof.js` should also look familiar. This was the last stage in the module. You can use this function to prove a name is in the merkle root, as show in the example.
